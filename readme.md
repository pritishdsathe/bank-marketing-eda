# Bank Marketing Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project involves a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset, which contains information about direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to understand customer behavior, demographic patterns, and financial profiles that influence the subscription rates of term deposit products.

Through comprehensive data exploration and visualization, this analysis provides actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and enhance overall campaign effectiveness.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes information on customers contacted during phone marketing campaigns, covering attributes such as:

- **Demographics:** Age, job, marital status, education, housing and personal loan status.
- **Campaign Information:** Number of contacts, month and day of last contact, contact communication type.
- **Financial Information:** Bank balance, previous campaign outcomes.
- **Target Variable:** Subscription status of the term deposit (yes/no).

The data consists of thousands of customer records, allowing for robust statistical analysis and meaningful insights.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze distribution and uniqueness of marketing campaigns.
- Explore demographic characteristics and their impact on subscription rates.
- Examine loan and financial product ownership across customer segments.
- Investigate timing and contact methods used in campaigns.
- Identify customer groups with the highest potential for subscription.
- Highlight areas for data quality improvement and risk assessment.

## Analysis Summary

### Campaign & Contact Analysis

- Majority of contacts concentrated in first five campaigns.
- Cellular communication is the most effective contact method, yielding the highest leads.
- Subscription rates vary significantly by month, with October, December, and March showing peaks.

### Customer Demographics & Behavior

- Education level strongly influences subscription: tertiary-educated customers lead in subscription rates.
- Retirees and students have higher likelihood of subscribing, suggesting demographic targeting value.
- Loan ownership status correlates with subscription, with no-loan customers more likely to subscribe.
- Job roles like blue-collar show higher negative balance prevalence and lower subscription rates.

### Financial Product Insights

- Customers with housing loans are more common in blue-collar and services sectors.
- Entrepreneurs and customers with personal loans have lower subscription rates.
- Negative bank balances associate with decreased subscription, emphasizing risk factors.

### Data Quality Observations

- ‘Unknown’ categories in job and education show moderate subscription rates but represent data gaps.
- Enhancing data completeness will improve segmentation and targeting.
